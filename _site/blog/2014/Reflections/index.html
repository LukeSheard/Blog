		<h4>Freshers week is undoubtedly one of the most nerve racking experiences of ones life.</h4>

<p>Moving away from your family, moving to a new part of the country, moving in with people you've never met before. The list of things beginning with "moving" and including "new" or "different" can go on for as long as your patience allows.</p>

<p>Being a photographer and writing a blog gets you places, that's for sure, and at the beginning of my second year (last September) one of those places was helping with Goodricke College Freshers week. While, technically at the time, not my college I had many friends at the college. So, after deciding with one of my friends the afternoon of Fresher move in day, it was only natural for my friend (who wasn't helping with the day) and me to visit the college and pay everyone a visit. To cut a long story short, we ended up talking about photography and I ended up being told that I could take pictures all week if I wanted. Not wanting to miss the chance of having a free 2nd Freshers week (after the shambles that was my first one) I immediately took up the opportunity.</p>

<p>When the hashtag '<a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23throwbackthursday&amp;src=tyah">#ThrowbackThursday</a>' appears up as a trending topic on Twitter I couldn't help but be reminded about this week, because it has pretty much defined the past nine months of my life. So it's time for my Throwback Thursday blog about how this crazy year began.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see the atmosphere on the Saturday evening at the welcome drinks events, for many it was the first time meeting their flat mates and STYCs (A University of York freshers week helper 'Second and Third Year Contacts') who would be looking after them for the week and guiding them on the 'dos and don'ts' of University (hint: there's very little don'ts.) Although I have to say that it was evident the free wine and nibbles help these kind of things.</p>

<p>The nerves seem to go as soon as the first 'proper' event started that evening, dubbed an ABC (anything but clothes) disco many of the freshers just turned up in bin bags. Quite the look these days it seems. As an outsider to the whole process of mentoring students through the week it was quite interesting to see the bonds all ready form and STYCs and freshers grow closer. You notice friendship groups form and people encourage each other in everything (from my experience certainly drinking, although not mentioning anyone in particular...)</p>

<p>Now, moving back to me, when I look back on this week a whole and looking at the quality of content I produced it was astounding to see how far I've come in just over sixth months. If you look back through my <a href="http://www.fb.com/LukeSphoto">Facebook Page</a> you can see the photos that come from the week and many are just not even worth publishing anymore. Compare it to something from my recent works like <a href="/portfolio">Live at Leeds</a> anyone will admit I've come on.</p>
<p>So what's the point in all this rambling?</p>

<p>When I was talking through development with a lovely photographer called <a href="http://www.bethanmillerphotography.com/">Bethan Miller</a> (who is ten times better than me, you should check her out as well!) about how far, how quickly you come on. I concluded that it's not necessarily about who you're shooting. It's about getting out there and exploring the world. You're not going to land a festival unless you can prove you can shoot in a crummy little bunker in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>People always ask me things like "how did you get so good at photography" or "what do I need to do to be as good as you?" or, more often than not, "you're so lucky to be able to do festivals and concerts like that!" I'll tell you now that I'm an extremely unlucky person normally. I'm not special but I do try and work hard, there's rarely a time when I've not got a camera on my (if you include my iPhone for instagram then I've always got a camera on me!)</p>

<p>Just take the feature image for this post, the left is what I edited that photo to in September when I last shot <a href="http://www.mikedignam.com" alt="Mike Dignam">Mike Dignam</a>. The right is what I re-edited that photo to a few days ago when I was updating albums for this site. Practice makes perfect, right?</p>

<p>I think personally it's a real kick in the stomach to see someone get a lucky break, and sometimes it's questionable about how they really got it. If you look at the recent trailer for <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/an-interview-with-marcus-haney-the-guy-that-has-broken-into-coachella-bonnaroo-glastonbury-and-the-grammys">No Cameras Allowed</a>, a documentary about Marcus Hanley, many many people are questioning whether it is just a marketing campaign to make people believe the music industry is still accessible. Personally, I think it is. But that's because I know how difficult it is to get in to small shows. Let alone break in to and be allowed on stage at Coachella. </p>

<p>So sometimes, yes, it's about being in the right place at the right time to get those jobs. Generally though, it's just about practice and determination and most importantly dedication.</p>
