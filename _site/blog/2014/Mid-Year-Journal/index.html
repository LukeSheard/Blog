				<p>When presented with a task that comes down to summing up 17 weeks of, frankly, chaos, I've spent too much time thinking about this before I could even begin to write about it all. I thought about trying to write week by week by piecing together Facebook posts, text messages, e-mails and memories. But then realized that would probably be boring and a long narrative. I can answer the first question pretty simply though: I am extremely happy. Happier than I could ever have imagined being.</p>

<p>There's a strange relationship people use when describing how they feel about the academics, the stress and the pressure that comes with being a student here, but I don't want to talk about that for the moment. I want to talk about how, at Cal, everyone is doing something other than studying a subject. For me, this is ultimate and <a href="“http://www.berkeleybside.com”" target="“_blank”">B-Side</a>, a music magazine where I take photographs and review performances, but I’m sure that if I wanted to I could do more. I am constantly astounded by the drive of students who hold down good grades, a job and maybe a society; the guys who play football 8 days a week in a stadium for 60,000 and still take the same (if not more) classes than me.</p>

<p>For someone on the outside this is one of the biggest things I have overcome, finding a way to fit in with all of this. The atmosphere is so different to York where, instead of meeting at the bar for a few drinks, you meet -- after ultimate practice -- at 1pm on Sunday (when the library opens) for brunch over some essay, class discussion or you just take the general “let’s get things done” approach.</p>

<p>San Francisco is one of the most beautiful parts of living in the bay area. It's such a vibrant city, sometimes I question whether it is more vibrant than London, with so many more areas -- although with that comes expense. I was fortunate enough to meet <a href="http://marisdyer.wordpress.com">Maris</a> early in the semester, a fact I'm sure that my friends know by now, who works in San Francisco during the week and glady took me to explore the various districts. In fact she is the reason I know about "Little Italy" (North Beach). However my favorite district of the city has to be the Mission; maybe jointly tied with Downtown but, excuse my 'alt-ness', that's too commercial sometimes. When I first arrived in the States some friends and I ventured in to San Francisco in hunt for "bits 'n bobs" for our rooms -- this is before we knew about IKEA -- and we found Mission Street with stores that were packed with various old chairs and lamps. I have to admit that there were so many things in those stores that I could have bought, yet somehow I restrained. Somehow. Just.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to overcome the feeling of being a tourist sometimes as well, because of the very fact that you want to see all of the sights and do the tourist adventures. This, I have to say, was one of my biggest concerns I had when I was planning my exchange here. I wanted to be immersed with the culture and the people, even if it meant being lost for a few weeks. I feel extremely lucky to have found the friends that I have. They put up with my constant confusion of everything simple (even down to the language we both use) and me wanting their knowledge on American simplicities -- without them I wouldn't have known about TopDog for weeks longer. Something that is now a constant savior.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that has made me feel most like a local. Being taken to the college football games each weekend, learning the chants and giving high tens whenever we do anything good. It’s the small -- by American standards -- things like this that make me feel local and involved in the community. Americans have this strange attachment to sport, more so than other countries I've visited. There is a deep ingraining of the culture and 'brotherhood' around the teams and, while I might be more biased because I prefer a lot of American sports, I think that it's certainly easier to strike up a conversation around; for example, football over soccer or cricket. Although I'd be surprised if you could find an American that knows, let alone understands, something about cricket.</p>

<p>America seems to judge school spirit by the attendance and volume of the student body at sports games. For Cal the most important game of the year is the "Big Game" against Stanford. During the week leading up to the game the campus is lit up in blue and gold (the school colors) with lights around Sather Gate, one of the big campus landmarks on the path leading to the center of campus. At the end of the week there is a huge rally about how Berkeley is (obviously) better than Stanford.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is holiday that is not traditionally celebrated in England, albeit beginning to become a more modern tradition that I see my friends posting pictures on Instagram about these days. As an 'alien' to the States, exchange students can't all just return to their families for the four (although once everyone misses class the day before Thanksgiving to go home, five) day holiday. Everyone told me that when I got to the USA that one of the first things people might do is invite me home for Thanksgiving, in the tradition that there seems to be some competition over who can have the largest number of people over to celebrate with. Of course, this is one of the things that were entirely true and something I look back on with hilarity. Celebrating with Maris and her family was somewhat bizarre, in a good way. The thoughts Thanksgiving represent are something that we can all think about whether we celebrate the holiday or not, but I invite you to read more about what I think on my other blog post.</p>

<p>Now I have to admit that I am late reflecting on my term at Cal. I sit writing this from a hotel room in New York in 2015, a completely different year to when all these events of Fall semester occurred. But I have two weeks left of my winter vacation to enjoy, and shall do just that, even though I confess some anxiety to going back to Berkeley in just under three weeks. I talked in the beginning of this that there is a strange relationship people have with the lifestyle of studying at Cal. A somewhat love-hate relationship. This is something I feel now more than ever when I reflect upon everything. Don't get me wrong -- I love studying at Berkeley, everything about it has positive memories, but when I look back, do I see just those memories? No. You remember the midnight sessions in Main Stacks cramming for a midterm at 8am the next morning (although I was fortunate enough not to have any of those, unlike some of my friends.)</p>

<p>When people ask me what's the biggest thing Berkeley has taught me, I have to stop and think. It's not a secret among my friends that I don't do badly at York, but here it's an entirely different story. Berkeley is tough, tougher than anything I've known before. But also it's so rewarding. I think I have gotten much more out of this semester here than any term of high school of university, but--it's impossible to be perfect here, and so I jokingly answer <i>Berkeley has taught me to fail</i>, which is no bad thing in my opinion.</p>
