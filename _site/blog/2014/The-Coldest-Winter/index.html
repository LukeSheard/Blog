		<p>I’ve been asked by the international office exchange office in York to keep a journal of my year in California.</p>

<p>*Side note* I’m writing this after surviving the Bay Areas biggest earthquake for 25 years. Apparently. That was a nice welcome to California.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent when I arrived in California that the only real culture shock was the dramatic size change. San Francisco is a completely different world to England, even London. Although I have to admit that californians have this way of life I settled in to immediately, probably because my friends are always saying that I’m probably American on the inside.</p>

<p>The Bay Bridge is a huge structure, what is pictured is a panorama I took of the San Francisco side. The island on the left of the picture is Treasure Island. Then there is a second expanse on the other side, which connects it to Oakland. I can deal with large roads, 7 lane freeways seem all most natural. There’s a lot of traffic, so build big roads. But when their equivalent of the underground in London was a 10 carriage train the size of East Coast trains, I was a little surprised. But again, I could manage.</p>

<p>The real surprise has been campus. Everything is just off the scale, compared to York. I knew that Berkeley was on a hill, and that I would be living at the top of the hill. But I didn’t not realize the scale of the campus or the hill. It’s something we would probably call a mountain if it was in the United Kingdom. From the clock tower all the buildings are similarly large. The math building in York is a small complex of offices spread across two floors. Here it is a 10 story high rise block, completely obscuring the view over the bay from my room – but that’s another story, filled with a library, offices and numerous classrooms. I daren’t think about how many rooms there actually are there.</p>

<p>Over the past week I’ve been staying with my uncle, who has lived in the Bay Area for a number of years now, has been telling me that some of the ‘hills’ in the surrounding area of the bay are taller than Ben Nevis, and if I head up towards Yosemite that I should drive slowly in case I get altitude sickness. Not the most reassuring thing to hear about.</p>

<p>Despite all this, the campus is stunningly beautiful. The Sather tower is the new Central Hall as the central landmark on campus. A victorian clock tower that you can look over the whole of bay towards the golden gate bridge. It’s free to go up, if you’re a student.</p>
