		<p>New York is a famous tourist destination and there’s no doubt about that. However when faced with the idea that you want to get as much of New York covered in one day as you possibly can then the thought of what’s important really begins the linger, then and afterwards.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now I can’t help but feel like there was so much more we could have done with our time in the Big Apple. We didn’t go and see a high production Broadway show, I didn’t even know the UN building existed in Manhattan, Central Park was barely discovered (or at least that’s how you feel when you’re looking down over the city.) Then there is Brooklyn. Queens. The list goes on, but I don’t want to dwell on what I didn’t achieve in my time in this wonderfully bizarre city. In reality this city is crazy, and not in a bad way. The constant bustle of people, tall buildings, high expectations and low temperatures were a mix I was not quite prepared for and unlike anything I’d see anywhere else.</p>

<p>Of course when visiting New York you have to see the old, the new and the classics.</p>

<h4>The Classics</h4>

<img src="/images/New York Tourism/Inline1.jpg" align="left">

<p>One of the things I’ve always dreamed about doing while in “The Big Apple” is visiting the Empire State Building. As a British guy being brought up oversees the Empire State building is described to us as the icon of the city. While it’s true that it’s one of the most impressive buildings having see the whole thing in person I’m not sure whether that is true anymore. The city seems to have evolved around it with it as it’s icon and now, as many argue and tell my incessantly, there are places like the Chrysler building with Top of the Rock if you want the views the that Empire State Building offers.</p>

<p>However for us on a weekend which is supposedly one of the busiest of the year, the lines to visit either of the views were too long to warrant the wait. That and we discovered that Maris and I can’t handle the cold as well as we once thought. So while my dreams of climbing to the top of a building us foreigners long after, it still hasn’t happened yet. But do I regret my decision? In my heart, I have to say I think about it. Would it have been worth it? I don’t know. Honestly, I think it was just as impressive to see the layout of the city from the plane.</p>

<h4>The New</h4>

<p>Maris had pointed out a park called “The Highline” on the west side on Manhattan. The basis of the park is that it’s formed from an old subway line above ground and presents views across the city and down various avenues – which are pretty incredible when you look down across the street.</p>

<p>The park itself I found one of the best bits of my visit. The whole place seems tranquil in a place that is bustling and crazy. Although the wind sometimes made it cold and not the nicest walk over all it was incredible to be able to see views across the city and artwork on buildings alongside the tracks. I only hope that I can visit it again in the future to see how the park grows and evolves as plants and trees grow around everything.</p>

<p>The idea that the highline is new is interesting though, when one thinks about it. Is it really new? It's fashioned out of the old, as is most things in the cities these days. Everything around us is contantly evolving and now we're living in a world which is completely in the middle. Old and new living in harmony.</p>

<h4>The Old</h4>

<img src="/images/New York Tourism/Inline3.jpg" align="right">

<p>The statue of liberty is the shot that everyone wants as a tourist. We took the Staten Island ferry across the water, along with a couple of thousand of other tourists, all vying to get the same photos.</p>

<p>I have to say that there’s something really surreal about finally having a photos from around New York. I look back at them and it seems like a wonderland of mystery and glass windows. You get to look through at this world you can’t really touch and wonder what it would be like to be on the other side. Living in that little box with people lusting after your city, your life. While I’m sure that, like any other city out there, it’s not all rainbows and gold showers.</p>

<p>In all of the five days of New York I feel like I barely scratched the surface of it’s secrets, and I question whether you could ever know all of a city like that. I compare it to London so much because of the various districts. So different yet so closely linked.</p>

<p>Until next time, NYC.</p>
