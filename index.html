  	<h1>Hello!</h1>
  	<p>I'm a blogger, designer and engineer, but you can <a href="/about/">read more</a> about that elsewhere. However really I just have a passion for building things and sharing experiences.</p>

	<h4>Latest Blog Posts</h4>
	<p>I've always found that blogging is something that is extremeley rewarding and can help other people and my peers, for this reason I try and keep a regularly updated blog.</p>

	<h4>Latest Shows</h4>
	<p>I volunteer for a magazine at Berkeley called <a href="http://www.berkeleybside.com/">B-Side</a> where I help head the photography team. This means I photograph bands who are on tour, which is a great privilege. You can see the extracts from the galleries I produce below or see more on <a href="/shows/">shows</a>.
