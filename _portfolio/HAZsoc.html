		<p>HAZsoc is a society at the University of York that I founded in Feburary 2012. I developed the society from the ground up including the original logo theme and website (which unfortunately was taken down by the latest committee in Janurary 2015).</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We are a new society at York University. We organise games of Humans vs. Zombies and Assassins Circle for students as well as other Campus-Wide games.</p>

			<p>Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. All players begin as humans, and one is randomly chosen to be the “Original Zombie.” The Original Zombie tags human players and turns them into zombies. Zombies must tag and eat a human every 48 hours or they starve to death and are out of the game. </p>

			<p>Assassin is particularly popular on college campuses where players try to eliminate each other from the game using mock weapons in an effort to become the last surviving player. Game play occurs at all hours and in all places unless otherwise disallowed by the rules. Since an elimination attempt could occur at any time, successful players are obliged to develop a healthy degree of watchful paranoia.</p>
