		<p>During the summer of 2014 I worked as an intern for a private dental firm in York, UK, as a graphic designer helping to overhaul their old website to something cleaner and search engine optimized. The process went through from producing an original wire frame on photoshop to helping with the web developers who were located in Sydney, Australia, with producing the wordpress theme.</p>
		<p>As well as this I helped to re-produce content with a focus on improving the quality. This included retaking photos of the offices and environment and editing them for the new website as well as helping to improve the copy for the pages.</p>
		<p>The new site went live in September 2014 and can be viewed <a href="http://www.freshsmiles.co.uk">here</a>.</p>
