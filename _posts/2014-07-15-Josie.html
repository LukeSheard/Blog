<p>Josie has been one of my best friends since high school and on the last time we would meet before I head to America I shameless recruited her to model for some portrait shots, since I don't think she has enough nice pictures of her. Certainly not after the most radical of hair cuts I've ever seen her have. These days when I edit portraits I tend to use the <a href="http://vsco.co">VSCO Film</a> packages. There's something about them I just love. One of the things I sometimes dislike about digital photography is the clinical feel some pictures have to them, and I like the way that VSCO take that away, adapt the color to something like you see on old Kodak or Fuji film.</p>

<p>We headed down to the quay for a walk along the river which I thought would yield some of the best locations for the kind of shots I wanted. I'm not quite sure how I'd describe the dress sense she holds, or the hair style she currently has is plain and short. Apart from the blonde quiff, and this is what I wanted to be able to show off with the photos. </p>

<p>When you only have a 70-200 lens with you a model standing means you can't really get much of them in, unless they're a dwarf. Which while Josie is short, she's not short enough to be much help in this matter. For this reason I decided that we should probably get more of her in and quickly moved to the little 'benches' scattered along the riverside walk we were following. I think that the middle image in this set is my favourite from the shoot because it captures the awkwardness of how many people feel when you say "stand [or sit] there and be interesting" - what do you do with your hands, where do you look? It's just sweet and somewhat endearing.</p>
