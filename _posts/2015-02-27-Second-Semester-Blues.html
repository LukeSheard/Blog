<p>When I first moved here I have to admit that I begun to realize how little time I had here in the grand scheme of things. I remembered when I first moved in to college halls nearly two years before, and how quickly that two years had gone. How could I make this two semesters drag longer than before?</p>

<h5 class="center">I had no idea. I still don't.</h5>

<p>Now I sit here with ten weeks left and I begin to wonder: where did it all go by? I know that at the end of the year I will inevitably sit down and reflect, review and try and break down where my year has gone. <i>TL;DR, there was a lot of time spent in the library.</i> but I still get this sense that I feel blue about it all. As an exchange student you should enjoying your time constantly, it should almost be a vacation. I wish it was. There is always so much more to explore when you really get to know a place in the way that a resident does, and I suppose that is the curse of spending a fraction of time a resident anywhere. You develop some sort of connection with the place.</p>

<p>For a lot of people I know though the connection is one that makes them feel like a tourist still. It doesn't matter what your skin color, knowledge of the surroundings or visa status. You will always be a foreigner to your exchange destination because of your accent and your clear lack of depth - by which I mean knowing all the colloquialisms of the place you live in currently. With all of that though I can empathize with them and understand their point of view, but it's not necessarily the one that I hold.</p>

<p>I think this year I have really begun to settle in to the idea of making this place my home. The only worry I have is whether the place would be as enjoyable if I were not a student, but I think that would quickly be squashed when I moved here and was allowed to explore the place with a fresh perspective again.</p>

<p>I've become deeply loyal to the city, it's people and the way of life. Even though the studying is much more difficult than at home, and I will certainly welcome a system where I don't have a pile of weekly homework that counts to my grades, midterms every four weeks and a social life that almost revolves around "so which hour are we meeting at which library again?"</p>

<p>So I guess this is the final stretch right now, to make the most of my time here. Explore. Wonder and enjoy what is left before the desperate drive  for employment.</p>
