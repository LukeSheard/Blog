<p>When I first moved here I have to admit that I begun to realize how little time I had here in the grand scheme of things. I remembered when I first moved in to college halls nearly two years before, and how quickly that two years had gone. How could I make this two semesters drag longer than before?</p>

<p>I had no idea. I still don't.</p>
