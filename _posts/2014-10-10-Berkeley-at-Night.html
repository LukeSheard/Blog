<p>So recently I was asked if I could help out with my friend’s astronomy project to photograph the night sky and see the transition of Mars (or some other planet) through the sky. This meant trying some long exposure shots with a tripod up a hill.</p>

<p>In Berkeley we have a landmark named “The Big C;” which, if you hadn’t guessed all ready, is very imaginatively named because it is literally a big C on the hillside. We decided that it would be a good idea to go to the Big C for 3 nights and take long exposures for the project and see if we could super impose them on top of each other to gain a view over the bay with all the stars in.</p>

<p>While I don’t think we got exactly what we wanted, we were treated to some absolutely fantastic views across the bay.</p>
