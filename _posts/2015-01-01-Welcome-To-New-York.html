Title: Welcome to New York
layout: post
location: New York, NY

<p>We arrived in New York on the morning of New Year's Eve. Having flown overnight we were quite tired and unprepared for the chill outside of JFK airport. It was quite bizarre in the taxi to Manhattan to see the skyline of skyscrapers that I had only ever seen in pictures: on the internet, in magazines when I was younger.</p>

<p>It's very strange sometimes to land in a place that, on the outside, seems to familiar but as soon as you are inside feels completely foreign and strange. So many shows and films are set in New York so I am well accustomed to seeing the buildings, parks and various plazas. Yet when you are walking around them for yourself you begin to get a sense for just how 'real' it is out there. When I have been talking about showing Maris around England she talked about how strange it alls seems that people live in the places that I've shown here and talked about. She's seen Big Ben, Parliament and that various tourist attractions in pictures and while on vacation. However when it comes to imagining real life happening in those places it seems bizarre and nonsensical.</p>

<p>For me this is the reaction I had when I reached New York. It should be that everyone there is just a toy person, placed there purely for the entertainment of others. It must have been the situation for me, somewhat surreal. Although I must admit that enjoying New York after a flight which leaves you craving bed is very difficult. Our walk through Times Square was one in which I felt colder than I could ever remember (although that may be due to the warm Californian climate) and took us through the south end of Central Park, past the Rockefeller center, and on to Grand Central Station. Another item on our NYC bucket list.</p>

<p>The station is as impressive as anything you see on the television or in pictures. It looked even more grandiose with the huge wreaths hung for Christmas, although I found the dominating American flag a tad excessive for my taste. I have respect for the members of Manhattan that use the station daily, I found the whole place a maze of stairs, runways and platforms -- I think I remember seeing something along the lines of 150 platforms. A number that would make even the union of Kings Cross, Liverpool Street, Waterloo and probably Marylebone look like a child's toy.</p>

<p>The evening of New Year's was filled with keeping warm. The temperature dropped extremely quickly as soon as the sun went down. Something that quickly reminded me of England. However we were lucky enough to find a space in the crowd where we could see the ball in Times Square, but also the fireworks that would go off at Midnight in Central Park.</p>

<p>It was unsurprising that a spot like this quickly filled up with people, they do not come easily, and we were all watching the thousands of people trying to desperately fill spaces with in Times Square -- seeing the New Year's entertainment that was put on with in the square on large well warmed and lit stages.</p>

<p>When midnight came around the crowds began to get visibly excited, but I'm still not sure if this was excitement of being able to leave for warm baths and central heating. However there was definitely something special about being at the place at that time. It's something like Disney, there's almost magic in the air.</p>
