location: Norfolk, UK

<p>While on a trip to my parent's house in Norfolk earlier last week I got talking to my friend, Henni, and decided that it would be good for both of us to go out for a shoot somewhere one evening. After much discussion of which place in Norfolk would be best (after the agreement on the broad area of "woods" - like there aren't enough of them in the county) we settled on going to Wells-next-the-Sea just before golden hour. </p>
This was my first ever portraiture shoot where I've gone to a location with the sole intention of shooting someone, and I have to say it was quite bizarre. 

<p>Across the evening we went to about 4 different places in the pine woods and on the beach. Unfortunately during editing I decided that I just didn't like the shots from one of them, so they're now in the trash. </p>
<h3>Pinewoods Grass</h3>

<p>Heading in to the woods I let Henni choose the first place to shoot, although this meant I went first at attempting to model. Somewhat nervous I let her boss me about as to how to stand and where to look, something I find completely unnatural. Nevertheless I tried my best.</p>
<h3>The Pinewood</h3>

<p>The second choice of location was a tree with a branch that looked rather like a curved back seat. Something I was more than willing to take advantage for shooting. Lending itself to shots where I could test out my newly acquired <a href="http://vsco.co/film">VSCO Film</a> packages I set ahead trying to make shots which would develop best using them. </p>

<h3>The Beach</h3>

<p>Lastly I decided that we should head down on to the beach. With different light it took me a couple of shots to get used to how I wanted to compose the shots to make use of the light and color. hoots to come though, certainly one with Henni again soon.</p>
