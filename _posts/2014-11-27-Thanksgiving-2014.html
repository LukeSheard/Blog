<p>Thanksgiving seems like a strange tradition to someone who isn't from America, but that is to be expected. Yet, when you think about it objectively, it seems like a very sensible holiday. </p>

<p>The idea that one must sit and reflect on the year, what they're thankful for and what was good about the year - although equally you could look for the bad. With some weird origins people seem to have forgotten I've seen a lot of my friends going on "Friendsgivings" rather than celebrating with family, but this seems to be something for people who live far away from their family. </p>

<p>Having achieved the goal everyone set me, of becoming a "token foreign friend" to bring home for Thanksgiving, I felt somewhat apprehensive about the whole experience. As I'd proven so far through the semester, there are a lot of mannerisms that don't translate across the Atlantic, many of which had caused me large amounts of embarrassment and flushed faces. </p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day goes by in a blur, everyone is curious to meet the British guy.</p>

<p>While I somehow came out with no photos of the actual dinner, I came out with a good couple of landscape shots. The dinner was something I would compare to Christmas dinner: turkey, gravy, vegetables and the like. The only dinner being the numerous pies that scattered the table for dessert rather than the traditional christmas pudding you might find in England. </p>

<p>The celebration though seems strange, for a country that holds itself above the rest of the world. Will gladly tell you it's best and is so patriotic about everything and it's present status, despite it's turbulent past. Americans have never really asked me about my past, only where I am going and what I am putting in store for myself. Yet what astounds me is that a country that does this has <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/">so many holidays</a> that concentrate on the past: President's Day, 4th July, Martin Luther King Day, etc.</p>

<p>So what exactly are Americans thankful for? Well, to me it seems the position they have got themselves in to. To be able to concentrate only on the future and to sort everything out that is wrong with the present and move forward.</p>

<p>At least that's what I think. It probably sounds marginally ridiculous coming from a British guy talking about a whole country from one experience though.</p>
