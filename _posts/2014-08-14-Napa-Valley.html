<p>Califonia is somewhat overwhelming. Everything in the state is so much larger, highways are sometimes 10-14 lanes wide. Building are the size of whole English complexes and there is a rather <a href="http://instagram.com/p/rlVOlmubfb" target="_new">fantastic bridge</a> that you can see from most places in the bay.</p>

<p>School starts in just over a week from now, so I've got a fair amount of time to explore. But yesterday I went over to the historic Napa Valley in the hope that I could get some photos for a Wanderlust post. As you can see I wasn't disappointed. The Napa Valley is famous for it's wine making. It's been famous since the 1960s but has been a wine producing region since the middle 1860s. The combination of the Mediterranean-esk climate, geology and location make it perfect for growing the grapes needed for wine. Something many people are probably very grateful for!</p>

<p class="clear">The wineries have grow in competition with each trying to outdo the other with scale and complexity. Although, as you will see later, there is one which, in my opinion, completely throws all others out the water. The first we stopped at was build in to a slight hill and was pretty impressive for a start. As you enter the courtyard opens out into a modern roman villa-esk area. With olive trees imported from the Mediterranean and planted on this side of the atlantic. Quite a feat when you think about it.</p>

<p>It also shows just rich the people that own these wineries are. Like much of American culture it's overzealous. From outside eyes I see no point in all of it, it's just pointless frivolities. But there was more to come... The V. Sattui Winery is situated just up the road from our first stop. I much preferred the classic style. Sitting more in the Mediterranean style with the brick arches the building is in fact older. The winery recently celebrated its 125th anniversary.</p>

<p>Overall the place felt much more reserved and traditional. Functional, sensible. That's how most people would probably describe it. While sat outside though, I was given the fright of my life.</p>

<p>As I was eating lunch outside I was suddenly surprised by the loudest horn I think I've ever come across. It turned out to only be a train. Although unlike our English trains it seemed, again, to be much larger than necessary to pull coaches. There is a tradition with in the Napa Valley that one takes this train along the whole of the valley over lunch or dinner accompanied by local wine, of course. This was the train that went past. The courtyard itself was chilled it out and, with the hanging lightbulbs, reminded me of a Mumford &amp; Sons concert. There was a lot of greenery and, despite the three year drought in California, a rather large fountain. I wonder how much that costs to run each year... It was, however, nothing in comparison to the second fountain I was to see later in the day.</p>

<p class="clear">This fountain sits with in an old friend to my parents. A winery they visited nearly 23 years ago, which today confused my mum. When they visited all that time ago the outside was painted a cream color with a strong maroon accent on columns and various parts of the inside. However when we rocked up expecting something similar we were presented with a slightly more bland neutral grey building. It wasn't until we found a history of the winery with a golden hour picture of the winery 5 years ago, still painted in the cream color, that all was settled in her mind.</p>

<p>I'm afraid to say that all of this was nothing in comparison to the winery we spotted on the way home. Simply, a huge castle. Boasting 8 floors (4 below ground). A drawbridge, portcullis and solid oak doors. Over 100 rooms. A petting zoo. And a moat. This simply was something incredible to behold. It is so large that I was having trouble get some of the angles with in the whole frame of my camera. So I will just leave you with the shot of the whole thing. A sight to behold and lust after.</p>

<p>If only I could make enough to afford that place.</p>
