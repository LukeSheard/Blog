<p>For spring break I decided to take a trip up north to Calgary in Alberta, Canada, to see a friend that I met about 7 years ago. I had a total of three nights in the country. Plan my plan went roughly like this. Land. Greet. Tour. Explore. Sleep. Depart. So let me break it down for you. </p>

<h5>Land</h5>
<p>My flight to Calgary left from SFO at 7am. I'd land in Seattle two hours later with a layover of one hour before arriving in Calgary at about 1pm local time, an hour ahead of the Pacific time I'd become used to over the last six months. As always with my travel arrangements though, something was delayed. I arrived at about 3pm after thick fog had prevented the plane from taking off the previous night, leaving them with a very early start the next morning to get all the people on the previous flight back down to Seattle. Ah well. Not the biggest upset to my travels I've ever had!</p>

<h5>Greet &amp; Tour</h5>

<p>Social media is a wonderful thing sometimes, I think if it were not for Facebook that there would have been little hope for my friendship with Matt to have lasted such a long time with such ease. I knew exactly what he looked like, even behind all the hair that had grown over his face, but it was definitely a lot different to the 16 year old I met when I was still was barely a teenager. He'd even come prepared with a little sign for me.</p>

<p>It was quite strange being in the car with Matt on the way back to his house, for the most part it was like nothing had changed between us and we were still those crazy kids when we first met in Atlanta. Talking about the same kind of things, but the adult version. For example: instead of discussing the crazy cars on the latest episode of Top Gear we were discussing the social politics around Jeremy Clarkson, or differences in driving for real rather than what we thought driving might be like. </p>

<p>The reminiscing went in to the evening until I was given my first taste of what the city would be like. We a drive in to town and was given the driving tour around, seeing the river that ran through the city and the different quarters. The city is vast and spread out, because Canada has so much space to expand, with a population of less than a million the city occupies a similar area to San Francisco bay or even the metro area of London.</p>

<h5>Explore.</h5>
<p>Monday brought exploring the city for myself, navigating the maze of a new place, and seeing what it could offer me. I awoke to a very cold morning and an early start for a college student. Off on the C-Train in to the city, a train / tram / bus service that allows residents to get in to Downtown and back home easily and (compared to back home at least) pretty cheaply. With free shuttles along the central street of downtown it was really easy to use.</p>

<p>I began with wandering across to river area that we had seen the day before, and see what the parks that were there could hold. See the downtown area from close and, I had heard of, a artistic bridge that had been center of attention for a couple of years. I personally thought the bridge was actually interesting. The design was simple but interesting and I'm sure in summer, where the river is filled and there isn't snow and ice resting all over the scene that it looks a lot better.</p>

<p>When I was walking around the main downtown area I kept seeing interconnecting walkways through the building and began to think that there might be a better way to get around the city. I quickly googled what all the signs for "+15" meant and discovered that Calgary has a network of walkways called, unsurprisingly, <a href="http://calgaryplus15.com/">Plus 15</a> because they are spread on the first floors of building about 15 yards above ground. </p>

<h5>Explore</h5>

<p>Tuesday brought with it the time to explore the Rockies. I've constantly been seeing images of Lake Louise. I was constantly stunned by the landscape as we drove up through Banff and in to the mountains. The rockies have much sharper peaks that the alps or the Sierra Nevada in California. However when we arrived at Lake Louise it was even more spectacular than I could have expected. </p>

<p>Situated in the valley of huge peaks, with Fairview Mountain the largest of those (seen in the left of the first photo above.) We went for a hike right across the middle of the lake and I managed to take an (almost) <a href="https://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=f99ac55d-d0a4-449e-95c7-84fd8ceb95fb">complete 360 degree panorama</a> from right in the center of the lake. It gives a sense of scale of the lake, and I was surprised by just how big it is. The hike across the center took nearly an hour, because we were walking slowly.</p>

<p>As always I have to find some way to embaress myself on trips abroad with friends and this was the place I would do it. Lake Louise has managed hiking paths around the edge and up in to the mountains around it. However I didn't realize how soft, and how deep, the snow was off the path. I saw a log with a large amount of snow (clarifcation here, when I say large I mean large for an Englishman who doesn't see a huge amount of snow in his life. This snow was at least 17 inches deep) on top of a log just off the path. I try to go for it to make a snowball and plummet about 3 feet down in the snow.</p>

<p>Safe the say that wasn't the most graceful moment in my life.</p>

<h5>Sleep &amp; Depart</h5>

<p>Canada was a crazy few days of trying to see as much as I could of the area while Matt still having to attend school and go to all his classes but it was far too cold for my liking. I hope that I can get back there in warmer weather and see the blue of Lake Louise and the summer in Banff in the near future. Until then though there is still plenty of the USA to explore.</p>
