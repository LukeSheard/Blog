<p>For spring break I decided to take a trip up north to Calgary in Alberta, Canada, to see a friend that I met about 7 years ago. I had a total of three nights in the country. Plan my plan went roughly like this. Land. Greet. Tour. Explore. Sleep. Depart. So let me break it down for you. </p>

<h5>Land</h5>
<p>My flight to Calgary left from SFO at 7am. I'd land in Seattle two hours later with a layover of one hour before arriving in Calgary at about 1pm local time, an hour ahead of the Pacific time I'd become used to over the last six months. As always with my travel arrangements though, something was delayed. I arrived at about 3pm after thick fog had prevented the plane from taking off the previous night, leaving them with a very early start the next morning to get all the people on the previous flight back down to Seattle. Ah well. Not the biggest upset to my travels I've ever had!</p>

<h5>Greet &amp; Tour</h5>

<p>Social media is a wonderful thing sometimes, I think if it were not for Facebook that there would have been little hope for my friendship with Matt to have lasted such a long time with such ease. I knew exactly what he looked like, even behind all the hair that had grown over his face, but it was definitely a lot different to the 16 year old I met when I was still was barely a teenager. He'd even come prepared with a little sign for me.</p>

<p>It was quite strange being in the car with Matt on the way back to his house, for the most part it was like nothing had changed between us and we were still those crazy kids when we first met in Atlanta. Talking about the same kind of things, but the adult version. For example: instead of discussing the crazy cars on the latest episode of Top Gear we were discussing the social politics around Jeremy Clarkson, or differences in driving for real rather than what we thought driving might be like. </p>

<p>The reminiscing went in to the evening until I was given my first taste of what the city would be like. We a drive in to town and was given the driving tour around, seeing the river that ran through the city and the different quarters. The city is vast and spread out, because Canada has so much space to expand, with a population of less than a million the city occupies a similar area to San Francisco bay or even the metro area of London.</p>

<h5>Explore.</h5>
<p>Monday brought exploring the city for myself, navigating the maze of a new place, and seeing what it could offer me. I awoke to a very cold morning and an early start for a college student. Off on the C-Train in to the city, a train / tram / bus service that allows residents to get in to Downtown and back home easily and (compared to back home at least) pretty cheaply. With free shuttles along the central street of downtown it was really easy to use.</p>

<p>I began with wandering across to river area that we had seen the day before, and see what the parks that were there could hold. See the downtown area from close and, I had heard of, a artistic bridge that had been center of attention for a couple of years.</p>
