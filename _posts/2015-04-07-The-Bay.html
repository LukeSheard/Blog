location: Grizzly Peak, CA

<p>Recently I was taking photos on a very bizarre weather day (I say bizarre, but in context I mean bizarre for Berkeley) for my friend's announcement photos. She suggested that one of the locations that might be good would be Grizzly Peak, the highest point in the hills about Berkeley. Obligingly I agreed and we went up there, but in the process I snapped a quick photo of the Bay and San Francisco in the distance. Never did I expect it to turn out like this.</p>
