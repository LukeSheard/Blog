<p>As part of my requirements to enter the USA next month I had to visit London and the US Embassy, unfortunately no photos are allowed inside and I didn’t want to look like a terrorist so I withheld taking photos. However after that intense morning I decided that I should explore and use the 2 rolls of film I had brought with me. Meeting up with some friends before America and just having a break to explore. This is day one.</p>

<h4>Southbank</h4>

<p>Before meeting my friend, Dan, I had some time to kill. Sitting underneath the London eye I noticed a street performer. Clearly small children can’t see over the crowds and I found this guy sitting on his dad’s shoulders quite adorable. Afterwards I sat down to take a break and these girls had just taken a selfie, clearly a high priority when in London. Although I missed the moment of the taking the selfie, I thought them disussing what to #hashtag it.</p>

<p>Wandering along from Westminister Bridge Dan and I decided that the Tate Modern would be a good place to pop in to and inspired by Jack Harries shots I recenelty saw of him in New York I tried to persuade Dan to do something similar. It didn’t work. Further along the riverbank we spotted a building with various colored neon strips scattered across the front. Behind another, much smaller, gallery we thought there was no harm in trying to find out more. While nothing came of this. It being nearly 8pm and nothing, including the gallery itself, being open to get information from. We gave up and kept wandering down the river.</p>
