<p>I have worked as a freelance designer and photographer since the summer of my second year of university. Specializing in events promotion and documentation, I've produced promotional material for various events around university societies; however I have also branched into do designing logos and websites. </p>
<p>As well as design work I have also been hired by York University Student's Union (YUSU) to cover their major events for the academic year: Live &amp; Loud, the lead event each year for Fresher's week; and Summer Ball &amp; Graduation Ball, attended by over 2000 students as an end of year celebration and graduation party for final year students. </p>
<p>The work has taught me how to balance paid positions and university studies as well as giving me a greater understanding of how to work with clients with in their time frames.</p>
