<p>Across the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college I was given the opportunity of working with a team of web developers and a specialist client as a design intern designing and overseeing the creation of a completely new, custom built, website for Fresh Smiles (a private dental practice in York, UK.)</p>
<p>The position heavily revolved around using Adobe's Creative Cloud software to handle the look and feel of the site to pass on to the development team, some of whom were based in Sydney Australia for the duration of the project. </p>
<p>We worked closely on the color schemes, page layouts and content feel before creating a custom wordpress theme and back-end CMS so that the client could customize all the content they required uploading. This allowed the site to focus upon improving search engine ranking, thus generating more traffic and potential customers. </p>
<p>My position also included re-creating a fresh and modern from the old branding the company was using. These were used on the updated the social media pages for the company.</p>
