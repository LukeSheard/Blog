<h2>My Story</h2>
<hr class="sidebar">

<div class="jumbotron center" style="margin: 20px; padding: 15px 45px;">
  	<h3>The Future</h3>
  	<p>Right now, I'm at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>, USA, studying computer science and mathematics. I am looking for an internship in the Bay Area to develop my skills, before I return to York to complete my mathematics Masters. Then I'll be looking to join a Computer Science Masters Program, or a job, in the USA.</p>

<h3>The Past</h3>
<p>I grew up between two places in England, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/London+UK/@51.4543339,-0.0740289,7z" target="_blank">London</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norfolk+UK/@52.723966,0.792224,7z" target="_blank">Norfolk</a>. I passed through primary school, secondary school and eventually ended up being accepted to the <a href="http://maths.york.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of York</a> to study Mathematics.</p>

<p>My childhood included a lot of experimentation to find things I enjoy. I spent my teenage years as a swimmer, FIRST LEGO LEAGUE (FLL) competitor and taking photos using my mum's camera. But I had a fascination, always, with computers and how they worked.</p>

<p>During my time at university I've used my free time to increase my proficiency in mark up and design. Learning <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>HTML5</code>, <code>CSS3</code> and some <code>Javascript / JQuery</code> (I'll get there eventually though).</p>
