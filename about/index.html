<h2>My Story</h2>
<hr class="sidebar">

<div class="jumbotron center" style="margin: 20px; padding: 15px 45px;">
  	<h3>The Future</h3>
  	<p>Right now I'm studying in the USA at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a> studying a lot of computer science and mathematics classes. It's my aim this summer to gain at internship at a company in the Bay Area, develop my skills and return to the UK ready to look for a masters program in Computer Science or graduate positions here in the USA.</p>

<h3>The Past</h3>
<p>I grew up between two places in England, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/London+UK/@51.4543339,-0.0740289,7z" target="_blank">London</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norfolk+UK/@52.723966,0.792224,7z" target="_blank">Norfolk</a>. I passed through primary school, secondary school and eventually ended up being accepted to the <a href="http://maths.york.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of York</a> to study Mathematics.</p>

<p>My childhood included a lot of eperimentation in finding thing things I enjoyed. I spent the vast majority if my teenage years as a swimmer, or taking photos on my mum's camera when I could get hold of it. But I always had a fascination with computers and how they worked.</p>

<p>During my time at university I've used my free time to increase my proficiency in mark up and design. Learning <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>HTML5</code>, <code>CSS3</code> and some <code>Javascript / JQuery</code> (I'll get there eventually though).</p>
