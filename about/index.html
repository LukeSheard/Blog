	<h3>Luke Sheard</h3>
	<hr class="sidebar">
	<p>I am an aspiring developer &amp; product manager currently working towards an MMath degree reading mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. After I graduate in summer of 2016 I plan on applying for a graduate program in computer science or for a job in San Francisco.</p>
	<p>This is a home-brew site that I developed using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank"><code>Bootstrap</code></a> as a place to showcase projects and host my resume, coded in <code>HTML5</code> and <code>CSS3</code> with some <code>JQuery</code> elements. You can view the source in my <a href="http://www.github.com/LukeSheard">GitHub</a> repositories.</p>
