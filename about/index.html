<div class="Bio">
	<h3>Luke Sheard</h3>
	<hr class="sidebar">
	<p>Luke Sheard is an aspiring web developer and internet enthusiast. His aims include: one day become a product manager at a leading technology firm, taking photographs of all his favorite bands and mastering PHP (for some reason I just can't get it).</p>
	<p>Right now he is studying in his Junior year at the University of California, taking photographs for <a href="http://www.berkeleybside.com">B-Side</a> and looking for an internship.</p>
	<p>This formulation of his blog was constructed through anger at wordpress and the cost of web hosting.</p>
